# ros-notes
Repo with my notes for ROS 1 and ROS2 from my Obsidian Vault

Text being enclosed in double square brackets indicates a link to another note, and if you see something of the form "\![[FILE.png\]\]" ,
then I've forgotten to convert that to something viewable in markdown. Please change it to the format "\![\]\(FILE.png)" to view the file
